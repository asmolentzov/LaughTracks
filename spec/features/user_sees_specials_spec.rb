# User Story 3
# 
# As a visitor
# When I visit `/comedians`
# Where I see a list of each comedian's TV specials' names,
# I also see each special's run-time length in minutes, and a thumbnail image.
# 
# - Image locations (URLs) can be stored in the database as a string.
# - Use the image URLs from IMDB or other online source for the special
# - Use CSS styling to scale the image smaller if needed to fit on the page
